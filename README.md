# Voltage-controlled-oscillator
A voltage controlled oscillator or VCO is an electronic 
oscillator designed for producing oscillation frequency by a 
controlled input voltage. The frequency of oscillation is 
varied by the applied controlled voltage. A VCO plays a vital 
role in communication system, providing a periodic signal 
required for digital circuit and also a frequency transmission 
in digital circuit. Their output frequency is a function of 
control input voltage. An ideal VCO is a circuit whose output 
frequency is a linear function of its control voltage. Most of 
the application as required a variable control input voltage 
as they required different frequency.
